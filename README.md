# Perform Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)

This project was completed as a part of the Honors portion of the [Python Project for Data Engineering](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project-for-data-engineering) Course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

Credit to IBM and the Coursera platform for providing the course materials and guidance.

## Objective

My objective is to execute the ETL process, which involves extracting bank and market cap data from the JSON file "bank_market_cap.json." I will then transform the market cap currency using the provided exchange rate data. Finally, I will load the processed and transformed data into a separate CSV file. By successfully completing this task, I aim to enhance my proficiency in ETL operations, data extraction, transformation, and loading, and demonstrate my ability to handle financial data effectively for further analysis and insights. Let's proceed with the ETL process to ensure accurate and structured data representation in the CSV format.
